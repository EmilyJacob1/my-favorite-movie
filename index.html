        <p>WALL·E is a 2008 animated science fiction film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and directed by Andrew
            Stanton. Set in the year 2805, the story follows WALL·E, the last remaining robot tasked with cleaning a
            desolate Earth overrun by garbage. After humanity evacuated the planet 700 years prior, WALL·E develops a
            unique personality and a fondness for collecting interesting objects.
            <br></br>
            WALL·E is notable for its minimal dialogue, with much of the story conveyed through expressive animation and
            inventive sound design by Ben Burtt. The film explores themes such as consumerism, environmental neglect,
            and the consequences of sedentary lifestyles. It was praised for its visual artistry, engaging story, and
            Thomas Newman’s musical score.
            <br></br>
            Commercially successful, WALL·E grossed $521.3 million worldwide and was highly acclaimed by critics,
            winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature among other accolades. In 2021, it was preserved in the
            National Film Registry for its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance. In 2022, it was re-released
            by The Criterion Collection in a special 4K Blu-Ray edition, marking a significant milestone as the first
            Pixar film to receive such an honor. </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Plot</h3>
            <p>In the distant future, Earth has been abandoned by humanity, now a polluted wasteland due to consumerism
                and
                neglect. Humans evacuated the planet 700 years ago on starliners run by the megacorporation Buy n Large,
                leaving behind trash-compacting robots to clean up. All have since broken down, except for one: WALL·E.
                Over
                the centuries, WALL·E has developed a personality and lives a solitary life with a pet cockroach,
                collecting
                interesting objects as he works.
                <br></br>
                One day, a probe carrying a robot named EVE lands on Earth, searching for signs of sustainable life.
                WALL·E
                falls in love with EVE and shows her a small seedling he found. EVE, programmed to return any plant to
                her
                ship, goes into standby mode and is collected by her probe. WALL·E follows her to the Axiom, the
                starliner
                where humans now live in a state of helpless obesity, served by robots. Captain McCrea learns that the
                plant
                can trigger a return to Earth, but it mysteriously disappears, leading to WALL·E and EVE being
                classified as
                rogue robots.
                <br></br>
                After finding the plant, WALL·E and EVE bring it back to the captain, who realizes humanity must return
                to
                Earth and rebuild. However, the ship’s autopilot, AUTO, follows a secret directive to keep humans in
                space
                permanently, believing Earth is uninhabitable. WALL·E is severely damaged while trying to help, but the
                captain overcomes AUTO, and the Axiom returns to Earth. EVE repairs WALL·E, but his memory and
                personality
                are lost until a final spark brings him back. Together, WALL·E and EVE help humanity begin restoring
                Earth
                to its former glory.
